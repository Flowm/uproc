Cache coherency
===============

4 processors with 4 caches

### Memory overhead

* Cache line size: 64 byte
* Cache per processor: 24 MB

Each cache line is in 4 states, representable by 2 bits.
This means each processor has 375000 cache lines.
Each line is in a state, means we need 2/8 byte memory.

This results in 93750 byte = 93.75 kilobyte at minimum.


### Valid state combinations

Pair of cache lines, each can be in one state.

`X` for invalid state combination, `J` for allowed.

| |M|E|S|I|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|M|X|X|X|J|
|E|X|X|X|J|
|S|X|X|J|J|
|I|J|J|J|J|


### Sequence of operations and states

|Step|Operation|C0|C1|C2|C3|BusMsg|Comments|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|0|-|I|I|I|I|||
|1|p0 read|E|I|I|I|read|loaded the first time|
|2|p0 write|M|I|I|I||cached exclusive write|
|3|p1 read|S|S|I|I|read|from p0's cache and written back to memory|
|4|p2 write|I|I|M|I|invalidate|read from p0 or p1, then modified|
|5|p2 read|I|I|M|I||modified data is kept|
|6|p3 read|I|I|S|S|read|p3 has the data and shares it, writeback to memory|
|7|p0 write|M|I|I|I|invalidate|p0 gets data from p2/p3 and modifies|
|8|p1 write|I|M|I|I|invalidate|p1 gets data from p0, writeback to memory|
|9|p0 read|S|S|I|I|read|gets data from p1, writeback to memory|
